# ReBrewie
Custom, Open-Source firmware for the Brewie B20+ (and maybe B20 eventually)

# Intro
I was planning on releasing this once it was a bit more buttoned-up, but seeing as how I haven't been able to do that I figured why not release it and maybe other 
people can help, or it can help someone else.

This firmware, for the most part, is fully compatible with the original stock Brewie software, but has been improved upon to allow more advanced features that were built into the B20+. Probably for lack of engineering time and for easy of code maintenance, Brewie chose to stick to the B20 firmware and not use the new features because they wouldn't be compatible. 

# Future Work
If someone has the time to try to port this over to the B20, that would be amazing. The main thing to figure out would be the pump control, since Brewie used valve controls to slow down the pump for hopping. Maybe PWM or some other sort of valve control would be suitable. The other piece would be the weight sensor, but all that would be required is to figure out where the data is and the rest should fit into the current flow.
